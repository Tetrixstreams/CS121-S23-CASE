Activity 3 was hard because I had to basically do 3 assignments. The even and odd wasn't too hard, all you do is use an if else statement in order to set numbers even or odd. 
The login was difficult but you Write a class Login that has 2 variables, userName and password, with appropriate values assigned to each variable. The triangles was the 
same as the activity 2 test scores, you set the range of the triangle as greater or less than and that's it.
