| Number | Project | Description |
| :-: | - | - |
| 1 | [Project 1](https://github.com/Tetrixstreams/CS121-S23-CASE/tree/main/Pokemon%20Battle/src) | Project 1 was a pokemon fighting game where you would create your pokemon and their stats and so would someone else. You would use attacks in a turn based battle trying to kill them. The winner was whoever had more health at the end along with points used to see who won the most rounds. |
| 1 | [Project 2](https://github.com/Tetrixstreams/CS121-S23-CASE/tree/main/Pokemon2/src) | Project 2 was also pokemon related but it let you create pokemon and assign them and print their stats as a formatted string. |
